      <h2> The Meeting </h2>
      <div class="story-content" style="display: none">

	<p>Debbie met Matt at a 1920s themed house party in early January, 2011. It should be noted that on the night of this party, Bloomington was experiencing one of its epic ice storms. Malika was determined to get to the party, so Debbie, anxious to drive in the ice storm, did a solid and picked her up for a prompt arrival to the party (thanks Malika!). Meanwhile, Matt and Ahmed stepped outside with plans to drive to the party only to find an inch thick sheet of ice coating every horizontal surface.</p>
	<p> "Well," said Matt, "I guess we aren't driving" </p>
	<p> "Definitely not." Ahmed replied with a laugh. </p>
	<p> Matt retrieved the spiked shoe covers he’d just received for Christmas. He wore one on the right foot and Ahmed wore one on the left and they struck out across town. Barely an hour later they arrived, literally coated in ice. They stepped inside shaking off shards and were greeted by partygoers. Matt shook hands with Debbie and smiled at her as they exchanged names. It should be mentioned at this point that although the party was 1920s themed, Matt had never been one to put too much effort into a costume... or his general personal appearance. This night he'd killed two birds with one stone by shaving off the majority of his bushy beard, leaving only a "striking" mustache.</p>
	<p> Not 15 minutes later a group stood in the kitchen, conversing about nothing in particular - Debbie stood across the circle from Matt, and then suddenly stuck out her hand. </p>
	<p> "Hi I'm Debbie, I don't think we've met yet," she said cheerily.</p>
	<p> Matt turned to her, surprised, and took the offered hand saying "we literally just met... You don't remember the mustache?!" </p>
	<p> Debbie quickly retorted by putting up her hand and saying “I try to forget it.” Fellow onlookers made the “deep burn” noise. </p>
	<p> From that point on, they barely stopped talking for the rest of the night, but before Matt knew it, it was time for Debbie to leave. Shortly after the 1920s party, Debbie and Matt started seeing each other almost on a weekly basis in group settings with other friends. Both agree they would look forward to those gatherings so they could see each other again.

      <h2> The Move </h2>
      <div class="story-content" style="display: none">
	<p>
	  As their tenure in graduate school drew to a close, it was time to make a decision. Matt’s new found motivation, combined with Debbie’s hunger to take the workforce by storm, led them to begin a job hunt which culminated in both of them finding employment in the DC area. The move went completely smoothly. They definitely did NOT have to wait over a week for their furniture and possesions. Also, Matt did NOT proceed to break multiple items on a daily basis while unpacking, including one of Debbie’s favorite mugs, and Debbie definitely DIDN'T get annoyed with the “Bull in a China shop” she was living with. But, they perservered through this lack of adversity and maintained a loving relationship as they settled into their first home and MD living.

      <h2> The Kiss </h2>
      <div class="story-content" style="display: none">
	<p> It was... electric. No one knows for sure who struck first, but they found themselves enraptured in each other's arms one night, standing between a Qdoba and a Starbucks (very creepy and poetic at the same time). They both pulled away with the biggest smiles on their faces, and either would have sworn that there was no one else in the world at that moment. Neither realized that their friends had just gotten tired of waiting and had gotten in line for the usual end-of-night burritos. </p>

      <h2> The Jobs </h2>
      <div class="story-content" style="display: none">
	<p> In the Summer of 2013, Debbie and Matt started their new jobs. Debbie was able to put what she'd already learned while doing her dissertation to work almost immediately while doing higher education consulting. Matt got down to business writing software and doing research into various aspects of network security. Of course Debbie was simultaneously working on her dissertation, and so the happy couple had gobs of free time. </p>

      <h2> The Dating </h2>
      <div class="story-content" style="display: none">
	<p> It wasn't too long after that first kiss (Debbie would tell you that it was an eternity), that they started dating. Their favorite memories from this time period were standing in the kitchen laughing uncontrollably, playing pranks on each other (Matt would leave all of Deb’s cabinets open and/or rearrange her furniture after she left to go to work), going on midnight grocery runs to make waffles with accidentally purchased chocolate milk, and all sorts of other normal couple things. Oh, and they worked; Debbie was cranking through her dissertation in addition to holding down a job at IU rec sports, and Matt who had traditionally been a bit of a bum, was consistenly impressed with her work ethic. It slowly began to rub off on him, and more and more often he found himself seated across from her at the kitchen table, laptops open, working furiously and playing footsie.

      <h2> The Question </h2>
      <div class="story-content" style="display: none">
	<p>After months of painstaking planning, Matt was finally ready. He'd chartered a small plane to the Outer Banks, piloted by none other than your co-officiant Brennon York. He'd invested in a beautiful peice of hand-crafted hardware from a master diamond cutter. He'd wrangled a small camera crew, and he knew it was time for the Q to be P'ed. After an only slightly turbulent flight on which Matt had no issues whatsoever, they landed in the Outer Banks. After a short drive to Jockey's Ridge State park, they hiked to the top of the highest sand dune. Matt pointed to a water tower far in the distance and then sneakily fished the ring box out of his swim trunks which he'd brought along 'just in case'. When Debbie turned around to determine the source of his fidgeting she found him down on one knee. She nearly knocked him over in her excitement, but he held her at bay... he had thought over what he would say, and he wasn't about to let all that preparation go to waste. </p>
